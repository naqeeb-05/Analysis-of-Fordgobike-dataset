## by Naqeeb Tahasildar


## Dataset
The Ford GoBike dataset contains the data of individuals who used the bike service in the greater San Francisco Bay area for the month of February in 2019. The data contains 16 columns with different variables such as trip duration, start station, end station etc. The 'user_type' and 'member_gender' contain qualitative nominal datatype.

## Summary of Findings

In the univariate exploration I observed that the variable duration_sec after log transformation showed a right-skewed distribution. On the other hand the log of distance variable showed a bimodal distribution. I also noticed that most of the users are male subscribers between the age 20-40. Additionally, more people use the service on weekdays than on weekends, between 7-9 and 16-18 being the most popular time.

From the bivariate analysis I oberserved that on average the customers take longer trips than the subscribers. Also, the average trip duration is similar across different genders. Even though less people use the service on weekends, the average trip duration was longer.

Finally, multivariate Exploration revealed that throughout the week the customers consistently take longer trips than the subscribers. Additionally, customers take longer trips on weekends than on weekdays. Furthermore the subscribers take on average same duration of trips throughout the week.

## Key Insights for Presentation

More subscribers use the service when compared to the customers. However, customers on average take longer trips. Morning and evenings are the most popular time when the service is used. Even though more people use the service on weekdays, average trip durations are longer on on weekends.
